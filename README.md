# budgeting
Command line code suite for setting up a budget and tracking expenses across multiple currencies.

The functions are very flexible, expenses and budgeting changes can be examined over dates, budget types, accounts, and user-specified notes or tags.  My intention was to setup a command-line-based framework that could later be analyzed using more complex tools in numpy or scipy (to be continued).
